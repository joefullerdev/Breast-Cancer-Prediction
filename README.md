# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This project can also ben found on [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/joefullerdev/breast-cancer-prediction)

The aim of this project is to predict whether or not a certain tumour is Benign or Malignant.
The data we are using is the [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wasiqaliyasir/breast-cancer-dataset) on Kaggle.

We used a **pytorch** neural network for a high prediction of approximately 99%. It is worth noting that these results are non-deterministic (stochastic),
so 99% may not be reproducable.
